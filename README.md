# GraphicalDesigns
Code to compute graphical designs, and a host of example graphs to play around with.  

The files entitled GDkScript(type).m allow the user to compute k-graphical designs for an input graph running through each valid choice of k of a certain type. The program for combinatorial designs is exact, in that it will find the minimum size of a k-graphical design for each k.  Positive and arbitrary weights are relaxations and hence not guaranteed to find a minimum size design.
